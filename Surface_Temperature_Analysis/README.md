# Earth Surface Temperature Analysis

In this analysis I will be looking at the dataset _[Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)_ by Berkley Earth. This dataset consists of temperature readings from around the world that go back to at least the 1760's in some areas and up until 2013.

*Note*: This analysis does not include the 95% confidence interval for temperatures.

This notebook is best viewed with [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kylepollina/Surface_Temperature_Analysis/blob/master/Earth%20Surface%20Temperature%20Analysis.ipynb). The *Contents* links will not work on Github.
