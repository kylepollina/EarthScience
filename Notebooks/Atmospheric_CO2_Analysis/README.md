# Atmospheric CO2 Analysis
The carbon dioxide record from [Mauna Loa Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Loa_Observatory), known as the “Keeling Curve,” is the world’s longest unbroken record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Scientists make atmospheric measurements in remote locations to sample air that is representative of a large volume of Earth’s atmosphere and relatively free from local influences.

The data in this notebook is a combination of data collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO), with datasets from NOAA and also from UC San Diego. The NOAA dataset only goes back until 1974 while the UCSD dataset has recordings going back until 1958 when the observatory opened. This notebook combines the two datasets and takes a look at the trends over the years.
